agreed Graphs data structure comprises various nodes and multiple edges connecting these nodes. The nodes of the graph are connected by weighted edges, which represent the distance to be traversed to reach there.
Dijkstra’s algorithm is an effective and proficient algorithm proposed by Edsger.W. Dijkstra to navigate the shortest distance and path to reach a given destination. 
Google Maps employs Graph data structures for the calculation of the shortest path from the source (point A) to the destination (point B).

Hamming distance is a measure of the difference between two strings of equal length. It is calculated by counting the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. For example, the Hamming distance between the strings "101010" and "111000" is 3 because they differ in three positions.

On the other hand, brute force is a general problem-solving technique that involves evaluating all possible solutions to a problem. It is typically used when the problem is small enough that it is feasible to evaluate every possible solution. Brute force can be used in combination with the Hamming distance to find the closest matching string to a given string, but they are not the same thing.

In some cases, brute force can be used to calculate the Hamming distance between two strings by comparing every symbol in the strings. However, this approach becomes very inefficient for long strings, and there are more efficient algorithms for computing the Hamming distance, such as bit counting algorithms.
