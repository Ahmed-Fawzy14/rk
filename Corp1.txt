Graphs data structure comprises various nodes and multiple edges connecting these nodes. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is an effective and proficient algorithm proposed by Edsger.W. Dijkstra to navigate the shortest distance and path to reach a given destination. Google Maps employs Graph data structures for the calculation of the shortest path from the source (point A) to the destination (point B). The nodes of the graph are connected by weighted edges, which represent the distance to be traversed to reach there. Thus Dijkstra devised an algorithm to find the shortest route from the source to the destination.
